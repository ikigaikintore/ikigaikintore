Defining the scope of the application and iterations.

Tired of using some applications because I don't like the way they work, I decided to create my own. Building a SaaS multiplatform.

## Objective

Deploy an application in a platform. Using containers.

The idea is when Google offered a personal page with widgets you could customize: weather, news, and so on.
